# Shark Attacks

  Project status - Completed
  Part of IronHack Data Analysis Course
  
# Project objective

  The project objective is to prove the following Hypothesis: Most shark attacks occur during surfing, with a higher frequency in the USA due to  the popularity of surfing as a sport, and these attacks are unprovoked.
  
  The data contains information about shark attacks around the world. Reference: https://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm

# Methods

  - Cleaning data
  - Filtering
  - Grouping (Pandas Pivot Tables)

# Technologies 

  - Python
  - Pandas
  - Python Functions (.py file)
  - Jupyter Notebook (.ipnb file, main program)

# Project Description

  The dataset contains incidents reported involving sharks, with information such as Date, time, location, Country, Type of attack, activity (what a person was doing), and other variables. For a full list, see the columns inside the GSA5F.xls file. 
  
  For our hypthesis, we focus on cleaning, filtering and analyzing via Exploratory Data Analysis and Pandas Pivot Tables for the variables country, type and activity.

# Steps

General steps done for analyis in main program:
  0) Import Pandas and .py helper functions 
  1) Read Excel file
  2) Rename column names (helper function) and drop non value columns
  3) Clean variable names (country, activity, type)
  4) Exploratory Data Analysis with Pivot Tables (country, activity, type)
  5) Tope 3 countries Pivot table and Hypothesis confirmation

# Conclusion

  Based on our analysis of the data, we found that the hypothesis holds true: That unprovoked shark attacks are most prevalent during   surfing, especially in the USA, in line with the sport's popularity.
  
  Notably, our insight reveals that in general, swimming has more reported incidents than surfing after thorough data cleaning. Further,    fishing has more reported incidents in Australia.
  
  It most be also noted that the data itself is a little bit bias, as the data put emphasis on USA.
